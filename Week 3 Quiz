1. Take a look at the 'iris' dataset that comes with R. The data can be loaded with the code:
library(datasets)
data(iris)

There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.

## colMeans(iris[which(iris[,"Species"]=="virginica"),c(1,2)])
Mean of "Sepal.Length" = 6.588 ~ 7

2. Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?
## apply(iris[,1:4],2, mean)

3. Load the 'mtcars' dataset in R with the following code
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number of cylinders in the car (cyl)? 


tapply(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$cyl,mean)
with(mtcars,tapply(mpg,cyl,mean))
sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
